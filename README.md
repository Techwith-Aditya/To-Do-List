# To-Do-List
This Advanced To-Do List app, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Features include adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks (All, Completed, Pending). Tasks are saved in LocalStorage for persistence, and users can also clear the entire task list with one click.
